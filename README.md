Here's how the guide would look as a `README.md` file for setting up Singularity's MeTTa (Hyperon) on Windows using WSL:

# How to Set Up Singularity's MeTTa (Hyperon) on Windows Using WSL

If you're diving into symbolic AI and knowledge representation, MeTTa, the language behind SingularityNET's Hyperon engine, is something you'll definitely want to try. This guide walks you through setting it up from scratch on a Windows machine using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

---

## Prerequisites

- A Windows 10/11 machine
- Internet connection
- ~20 minutes of your time and curiosity!

---

## Step 1: Install WSL on Windows

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) lets you run a Linux environment on Windows without dual-booting or using a VM.

### One-command WSL setup:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

This installs:
- **WSL 2** (faster and more powerful)
- **Ubuntu** (as the default Linux distro)

For more details, check the [official Microsoft WSL Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

After installation, restart your computer and let Ubuntu initialize.

---

## Step 2: Update Ubuntu (inside WSL)

Open the Ubuntu terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

This ensures your system is up to date.

---

## Step 3: Install Python 3 (if not already)

Ubuntu comes with Python 3 pre-installed, but verify with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If not found, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y
```

---

## Step 4: Create a Project Folder

Create a clean workspace for your MeTTa experiments:

```bash
mkdir MettaProject && cd MettaProject
```

---

## Step 5: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

This keeps dependencies isolated:

```bash
python3 -m venv MettaProject
source MettaProject/bin/activate
```

You'll now see `(MettaProject)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt â€“ that means the environment is active.

---

## Step 6: Install Hyperon (MeTTa Engine)

Install the Hyperon engine, which runs the MeTTa language:

```bash
pip install hyperon==0.2.2
```

---

## Step 7: Verify Installation

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
metta --version
```

If it returns `0.2.2`, ðŸŽ‰ you're all set!

---

## Step 8: (Optional) Open the Project in VS Code

If you use Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the [WSL extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl).
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

This opens your project in VS Code.

## What is MeTTa?

MeTTa stands for **Meta Type Talk**. It's a programmable, symbolic reasoning language developed by SingularityNET as part of their AGI efforts. Think of it as a flexible logic-based language for building AI knowledge systems.

## Final Thoughts

Youâ€™ve now got a working MeTTa environment on your Windows machine via WSL. Whether you're exploring AGI, symbolic reasoning, or just curious about new AI paradigms, MeTTa is a powerful tool to start experimenting with.
```

This format mirrors what you would typically see in a `README.md` file, making it easy to follow step by step. The markdown structure ensures it's well-organized and easy to navigate.
